# motor-breakdown-prediction

__Prediction of motor failure based on sensor readings.__  
__Task:__ 
- Predict motor failure on the next cycle or propose an alternative formulation of the problem of predicting it and provide solution.  
- It is given that the maximum cycle of the motor is the last cycle before the breakdown.  
- It is necessary to offer options for using the resulting model in practice.  

__Description of the [data](https://github.com/aziart/motor-breakdown-prediction/blob/main/data.csv):__  
- __id__: id of the motor
- __cycle__: work cycle
- __p00-p20__: sensor readings read during operation
- __s0, s1__: settings changed at the end of each cycle
